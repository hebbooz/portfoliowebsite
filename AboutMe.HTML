        <h2>Finance</h2>
        <p>I have had experience with investment portfolios in the past, and have also started a range of businesses. This has given me practical experience with finance, and has taught me the importance of careful planning and management of resources.
            In addition to my interest in traditional finance, I am also fascinated by the intersection of finance and technology. I believe that technology and innovation have the potential to revolutionize the world of finance, and am inclined to further explore this.
            I am looking forward to continuing my education in finance, and to putting my knowledge and skills to use in the real world.</p>
            <p>I interacted with blockchain for the first time in 2020, and have been active in this space since.</p>
