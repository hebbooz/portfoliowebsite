    <p> Designed to be mounted under the saddle or handlebars of any bicycle, THIRDEYE is an affordable vehicle detection sensor that improves road safety for cyclists and vehicles.
        Detecting vehicles approaching the cyclist of up to 30 meters away, the sensor alerts drivers approaching the cyclise via three white LEDs positioned underneath the sensor which pulse rapidly upon vehicle detection. 
        The cyclist is alerted of approaching vehicles via a wirelessly connected light positioned on their handlebars: turning green when no car is detected, and alternatively red when a car enters the sensors range. 
        Ultimately, a camera records vehicles within the range of the sensor, used as an investigative measure in the event of a cyclist to vehicle collision.

        <h2>Inspiration</h2>
        <p>
            I was inspired to develop this design solution due to the almost constant media reports of road-cyclist injuries and deaths. The need for cyclist protection and safety is non-negotiably an area that requires constant innovation, and, I saw one large opportunity within this space that could promote the safety of this sport on roads. 
        </p>
        <p>
            I realised that most cyclist safety measures were responsive tools: not preventative. Equipment such as helmets and safety cameras have been paramount to reducing road-cyclist injuries and deaths, however, have not reduced the incidence of road-cyclist crashes. There are existing technologies that do help in the prevention of cyclists crashing into motor vehicles (such as the Garmin Varia or a standard LED light), however, these technologies contain flaws that reduce their effectiveness, or prevent cyclists from using them - such as cost, practicality, or overall effectiveness.
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than deciding to 'reinvent the wheel' and create a whole new technology that would mitigate cyclist accidents with motor vehicles, I decided to fuse multiple technologies into one, to create an overall technology that is practical, efficient, and effective for road cyclists. I brought the vehicle detection principles from the Garmin Varia, the vehicle recording features from the Cyclic Fly 6, and the standard cyclist visibility attributes of a standard LED Cycling Light together in my project THIRD-EYE. 
        </p>
        <p>
            My goal in this project was to develop a prototype of an autonomous vehicle detection radar for a cyclist, alerting them of vehicles approaching their blind spot, and triggering a camera to record. It was essential for the product to be produced at a low cost and high quality, increasing the attractiveness for road cyclists to use the technology. Through improved cyclist and driver awareness, my ultimate aim for this project was to improve road safety for cyclists and motor-vehicle users.
